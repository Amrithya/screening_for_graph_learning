# Screening for Graph Learning

Graph learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on the analysis and interpretation of data presented in graph form. To learn a sparse graph, we use a coordinate minimization algorithm that updates an edge weight with each iteration and implement a variable screening method
to speed up computations.

The internship is on the topic ”Screening for Graph Learning” in Inria MALICE project-team, Laboratoire Hubert Curien under the supervision of Prof Benjamin Girault. The main goal of the the internship is to implement screening to
speed up computations in a set of graph learning algorithms.
